Main Idea:
    Given a set of objects, we need to rank the objects. (E.g. Ranking documents based on relevance to a query)
    For this a ranking function (rf) needs to be learnt.
    This function (rf) is learnt by optimizing a criteria (This is called a Ranking Loss)
    Ranking: This function can be used to rank newly given objects.

3 types of ranking functions:
    1. Point-wise ranking [Learning Instance = 1 object, Pointwise Ranking loss]
    2. Pair-wise ranking [Learning Instance = pair, Pairwise RL]
    3. List-wise ranking [Learning Instance = Entire object/list, Listwise RL]

Evalution of learnt RF = Ranking measures.
Relationship of Ranking measures and RLs is unkown.


Main AIM:
    Find relationship between RMs and Pointwise/Listwise RLs.

Proposed IDEA:
    Use an essential loss. (Need more reading)

Loss function understanding:
Pointwise - Try to get the label as per data
Pairwise - Try to separate the labels as much as possible.
Listwise - Doubt. We talk about permutations. It is only possible if #Lables << #DataPoints.
