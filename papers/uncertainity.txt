Learning very slow if we use mean for all the scorer lists.
Hence doing addition.


Doing sum also does not decrease the loss very fast
This is the problem ---> Using a list also creates this problem.


The issue is the there was no registration happening if we used list
SO we have to use nn.ModuleList
https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.ModuleList.html

The learning rate depends greately on weather we are doing mean or sum in the final batch..!!

Saving and loading works as is because we use module dict which has a state_dict
