Main Idea:
    We need to use ranking losses instead of other methods for the purpose of HPO algorithms.


Documentation (Agenda):
    First we need to Implement/create the infrastructure to learn ranking loss functions.
    So we need to read and understand / revise the ranking losses concept.

    We decided to model a ranking function using a deep neural network.
        Reason: reprentation capacity.
        For now defined a [input_dim, (32, RELU) , (32, RELU), 1]

    Creating a toy example to build and run our ranking function
        Can our scoring function learn to sort a list of numbers? 

    Obervations after completing the implementation of toy example with list wise ranking function.
        1. We do not have any output range of values as a reference. Hence the model can learn score values arbitrarily large
        2. We must control the output domain so that the training does not lead to underflow or overflow.
        3. This may make the output domain restrictive. Works for now, however, we may need a better solution for this.
        4. The learnt model is extremely sensitive to the learning rate and the number of epochs


    Applying this to HPOB... (With or without query)
