Problem Domain: Hyperparameter searching.
Keyword: Use Deep Kernel surrogates

Key points:
    1. Use transfer learning surrogates to get faster convergence
    2. Treat HPO as a few shot learning problem (In the context of transfer learning)
    3. Use kernel k(phi(x), phi(x')) where phi is a neural network that transforms x to a latent vector
    4. Learn parameters of phi(W) and kernel(theta) together based on historical meta data
    5. Fine tune both W and theta based on the given task. If possible use warm start for initialization.
    6. Learn output range variance by creating augumented tasks.


Quick note on expected improvement.
    First the mean and variance is calculated for the target Hyperparameter Setting.
    Considering the mean and variance of a particular HP, we calculate the following:
        Remove y_max from the set of all values of f(x) and lowerbound it by 0.
        Multiply the above value with the probability of the gaussian curve N(predicted_mean, predicted_variance)
        For a continous curve we need to integrate.
    Then we get the Expected Improvement for this HP setting.


Gaussian Processes:
    The output is considered to be a random variable.
    When have more than 1 data point, the output becomes a multivariate normal
        The output is a joint gaussian distribution.

Personal points (Probability vs Likelihood)
    Probability and likelihood are reverse in nature.
    Probability starts with a given set of parameters and caculates the probability of a given outcome to occur
    Likelihood starts with a given outcome, and we would like to determine the parameters.

    Marginal likelihood (Likelihood after marginalization of some parameters)
        integrates the effects of parameters that are not of your interest.

Note:
    Warm start is not essential for us. (It is not the main contribution of the paper)

Main motive of deep kernel learning:
    Learn the kernel function in the gaussian process.
