Key Idea:
    Use permutation matrices to represent sorting. Learn the matrix with the loss function.
    [0 1 0] [x]    [y]
    |1 0 0| |y|  = |x|
    [0 0 1] [z]    [z]
    Permutation Matrices are not smooth in the input space Hence relaxation is necessary for differentiability
    Relaxation is done by using a double schocastic matrices i.e all row and column matrices sum to 1.

    Unimodal
    Double schochastic

The idea of Permutation Matrices is taken from Neural sort - Neural sort (Impt ref)

PLACKETT-LUCE DISTRIBUTIONS -> Very important to explain the rationale about using score as a probability
    measure for our scoring function (Check section 2.1 of paper 2 (Neural Sort))
