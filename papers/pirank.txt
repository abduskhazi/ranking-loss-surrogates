Key Idea:
    Use permutation matrices to represent sorting. Learn the matrix with the loss function.
    [0 1 0] [x]    [y]
    |1 0 0| |y|  = |x|
    [0 0 1] [z]    [z]
    Permutation Matrices are not smooth in the input space Hence relaxation is necessary for differentiability
    Relaxation is done by using a double schocastic matrices i.e all row and column matrices sum to 1.
